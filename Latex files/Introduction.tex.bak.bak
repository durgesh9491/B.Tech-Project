\section{Introduction}

In this model attacker-targeted population is divided into five compartments namely susceptible, latent, breaking-out, antidotal and recovered compartment.
Here we have divided total computer nodes T into ten classes, namely, S(t) of non- infected targeted computers subjected to possible infection; S1(t) of non-infected computers of attacker class; A(t), A1(t) non-infected computers of targeted and attacker class respectively equipped with fully effective antivirus program ; L(t), L1(t) infected computers of targeted and attacker class respectively with virus in latent state; B(t), B1(t) infected computers of targeted and attacker class respectively with virus in breaking-out state and recovered class population R(t), R1(t) of recovered ones from the infection in targeted and attacker class respectively. The Schematic diagram of the model shown in the figure .Here it is assumed that the population has a homogeneous spatial distribution and the mixing of hosts follow the law of mass action i.e. The local population density is a constant through the total population size. Targeted population N(t)=S(t)+L(t)+B(t)+R(t)+A(t)   and attacker population  N1(t)=S1(t)+L1(t)+B1(t)+R1(t)+A1(t).
The primary goal of this model is to theoretically study the impact of firewall security rule base in controlling transmission of malicious objects. Many researchers investigated the impact of media awareness in biological disease spread using mathematical modelling used transmission coefficient function of the form $\beta(I)=\betae^{-mI}$ and established that multiple positive equilibria are possible when the media effect is sufficiently strong.Similarly we are taking firewall security as a media coverage factor in our computer network model of malicious code propagation.
. Non-linear function of the form? $\beta(I) = c1 - c2 f (I)$ is incorporated in the transmission term to investigate the effect of firewall security, where $$f(I)=\frac{I}{m+I}$$In the modeling of malicious code propagation, the incidence function plays a very important role, In many models, the bilinear incidence rate $\beta\~{S}\~{I}$ and the standard incidence rate  $\beta\~{S}\frac{\~{I}}{N}$are frequently used, where \beta measures the effect of both the propagation of the malicious code and the contact transmission rates. However, these incidence functions do not consider the impact of firewall security to the spread and control of malicious code propagation. The use of firewall security and alert has been found beneficial for reducing malicious code propagation. Initially researchers used media induced transmission rate of the form $\beta(I)=\betae^{-mI}$ which has two major limitations. We consider firewall induced transmission rate as $\beta(I)=\betae^{-m\frac{I}{N}}$in the proposed model which is more reasonable than $\beta(I)=\betae^{-mI}$ because $\betae^{-mI}\rightarrow 0$ as $I\rightarrow 0$, independent of the value of m. Since the firewall security and alertness are not the intrinsic deterministic factor responsible for the transmission, hence it is reasonable to assume that the transmission rate cannot be reduced below a certain level merely through firewall security alert. Moreover, even for a fixed m, the minimum transmission rate differs for different population sizes, which is not very realistic. On the other hand, $min {\beta(I)=\betae^{-m\frac{I}{N}}} =\betae^{-m}$ that remains unchanged with respect to the total population size.
